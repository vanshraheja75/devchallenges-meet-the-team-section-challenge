## Overview

![Thumbnail for the Meet the Team Section coding challenge](./thumbnail.jpg)

This is my responsive solution for the Meet the Team Section challenge. The goal was to create a clean, professional grid layout to display team member profiles, ensuring the design adapts fluidly from mobile to desktop screens.

### Built With

-   HTML5 (Semantic Markup)
-   CSS3 (CSS Grid & Flexbox)
-   Responsive Design (Mobile-first workflow)

## Features

-   **Responsive Grid:** Uses CSS Grid (or Flexbox) to arrange team member cards into a single column on mobile and a multi-column grid on larger screens.
-   **Semantic HTML:** properly structured content using `<section>`, `<figure>`, and heading tags.
-   **Visual Accuracy:** Matches the spacing, typography, and image alignment of the provided design.
